[04:00] <slenderestman> aw man
[04:00] <Luna> ok how do you solve OMEGASECTOR
[04:00] <slenderestman> big L
[04:00] <Luna> pleaaaaaaase
[04:00] <Beched> yoohoo
[04:00] <icchy> gg
[04:00] <slenderestman> who did
[04:00] <Luna> how do you get past omegasector part2
[04:00] <p1kosu> gg
[04:00] <Ariana> how does one even do old_school part 1 and 2 srsly
[04:00] <myria> hu..
[04:00] <slenderestman> maplestory
[04:00] <Pyhscript> Shalom[p4]: please omegasector stage 2 solution
[04:00] <Shalom[p4]> Luna you could write to file .php
[04:00] <terjanq> Ariana `message=<?=$_='$<>/'^'{{{{';${$_}[_](${$_}[__]);&type=/../../human_message/lol.php`
[04:00] <Luna> also that
[04:00] <Luna> and?
[04:00] <terjanq> its payload
[04:00] <Shalom[p4]> use alien to write weird shell
[04:00] <terjanq> for shell :p
[04:00] <_hellman_> Ariana: look at hex(n( of part 2
[04:00] <Shalom[p4]> like <?= `/???/??? ../??????.??? > ===` ?>
[04:00] <slenderestman> Ariana old_school part 1 is fermat factoring
[04:00] <Ariana> OHNOWONDER
[04:01] <Shalom[p4]> which copies secret.php to file ===
[04:01] <slenderestman> part 2 was yeah lol
[04:01] <slenderestman> i got part 2 first lmao
[04:01] <jason85> how to do pycalx?
[04:01] <Ariana> the source
[04:01] <Luna> oh so you could code something in php using only special characters

[04:01] <Ariana> AND WIN
[04:01] <_hellman_> slenderestman weird I tried it. How much is the difference between primes?
[04:01] <Luna> how does one search that?
[04:01] <terjanq> what is =+
[04:01] <bibi__> how solve omega sector part 1?
[04:01] <slenderestman> jason85 op=+' and part2 is somethins eomthing #
[04:01] <Beched> terjanq haha nice, i also thought of jjencode, but bash trick is simpler (/???/??? ../*)

[04:01] <Shalom[p4]> we got part3 first
[04:01] <Ariana> part2 is you use f strings
[04:01] <terjanq> jjencode? i wrote it alone xd

[04:02] <jason85> slenderestman, I got that, but I couldnt enumerate the full flag, I got stuck somewhere
[04:02] <sdfarhgeagdg> how do you solve house of cards?
[04:02] <slenderestman> part 3 was copying code lol
[04:02] <@ducnt> GGWP everyone. Happy hacking.
[04:02] <Shalom[p4]> part1 we brute forced...
[04:02] <Shalom[p4]> literally
[04:02] <slenderestman> oh jason85 there were like () and []
[04:02] <slenderestman> so
[04:02] <Ariana> Wait for the old_school is it like using factorization techniques
[04:02] <Ariana> oh
[04:02] <Pyhscript> terjanq: what even should I have googled to figure out that
[04:02] <slenderestman> you just put those in source variable
[04:02] <slenderestman> and go like
[04:02] <slenderestman> if source in flag
[04:02] <Shalom[p4]> we guessed it will be something like "ooollldd" and bruted this :D
[04:02] <Ariana> use source to binary search
[04:02] <Ariana> cuz can source<flag

[04:02] <alcastronic> dammit was after it but could not find ressources about that php payload
[04:02] <bibi__> how change?
[04:02] <Luna> in OmegaSector
[04:02] <sdfarhgeagdg> how to house of cards?
[04:03] <Ariana> then part2 you can use format strings magic
[04:03] <terjanq> please guys dont spam too much i cant find solutions
[04:03] <Ariana> to binary search
[04:03] <Shalom[p4]> bibi__ you can send whole hostname as uri

[04:03] <@l4wio> @terjanq lul
[04:03] <Pyhscript> Luna: yeah me neither
[04:03] <Luna> so that was the main idea
[04:03] <@bmtd> part _1 and part_3 you can solve using fermat factor technique
[04:04] <Luna> I knew it had to be something like that
[04:04] <Luna> but I didn't believe it was actually possible lol
[04:04] <@bmtd> too much overthink
[04:04] <Beched> Shalom[p4] lol the same, we guessed 1st part
[04:04] <_hellman_> bmtd: can you share factors of part_1?
[04:04] <Ariana> How long did the fermat take
[04:04] <WhoAmI> 0xbad minton.... really don't know idea how to increase course number > 2 to trigger bof in the backend server

[04:04] <bibi__> @sdfarhgeagdg just oob

[04:05] <sdfarhgeagdg> that's what i literally diddd

[04:05] <Pyhscript> but shark0der <?= i guess
[04:05] <sdfarhgeagdg> i spammed p64(flag_in_bss)*(0x400/8-1)

[04:05] <nazywam> sdfarhgeagdg:yeah, that was the payload
[04:05] <@bmtd> part_3 can be solve as fermat(1337*7331*n) or recover prime using MSB
[04:05] <sdfarhgeagdg> waht the fuck, i did that for an hour and didn't get flag

[04:06] <sdfarhgeagdg> @nazywam how many courses did you need to reach argv
[04:06] <Shalom[p4]> just collected ~20k ciphertext-modulus pair

[04:06] <nazywam> sdfarhgeagdg: https://pastebin.com/raw/HMt3cqC1 we did 6
[04:06] <bibi__> how change the $whoami in omegasector?
[04:06] <Ariana> So just bruteforce
[04:06] <nazywam> 4 should be enough perhaps?

[04:07] <p213> but I did found the flag ??

[04:07] <Pyhscript> thanks
[04:07] <Luna> terjanq yes but what strings?
[04:07] <Ariana> dont you need to compute the sha1s though
[04:07] <Luna> I mean
[04:07] <Luna> how does that work
[04:07] <Luna> it looks random
[04:08] <Shalom[p4]> Ariana oh well, yes collecting data took a while
[04:08] <Luna> any documentation/stuff to look at?
[04:08] <Beched> sdfarhgeagdg s.send('%s%s\n' % ('a' * 248, flag)) worked for me (flag = p64(0x604070))

[04:09] <Beched> so 20-byte payload is like include $key, and you send a path as a GET param name
[04:09] <Shalom[p4]> you could call bash from php via `` and then do bash magic like we did
